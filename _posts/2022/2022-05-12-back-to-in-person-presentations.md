Today, I gave my first in-person presentation since the pandemic. It was awesome! I was talking about the study I performed with [Nabeel Sulieman](https://nabeel.dev) about data visualization in environments that use right-to-left writing systems.

I wrote about this study in the past [[one](https://gorelik.net/2019/05/19/x-axis-direction-in-right-to-left-languages-part-two/), [two](https://gorelik.net/2019/05/19/x-axis-direction-in-right-to-left-languages-part-two/)]. Today, you may find the results of our study at http://direction-matters.com/. I hope to be able to publish the video recording of this presentation really soon.
