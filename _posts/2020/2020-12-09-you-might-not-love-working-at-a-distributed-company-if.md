A couple of weeks go, I wrote a post about an [unexpected hitch of working in a distributed team](https://gorelik.net/2020/07/13/unexpected-hitch-of-working-in-a-distributed-team/). Yesterday, my ex-coworker, Ann McCarthy wrote a [related, more elaborative post](https://nomad.blog/2020/12/08/you-might-not-love-working-at-automattic-if) on the same issue. It's worth reading.
