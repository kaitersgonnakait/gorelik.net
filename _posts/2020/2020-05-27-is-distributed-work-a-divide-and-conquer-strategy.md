Before becoming a freelance data scientist, I used to work at Automattic, which I [used to regard as my dream job](https://gorelik.net/2020/01/13/how-i-got-a-dream-job-in-a-distributed-company-and-why-i-am-leaving-it/). Not every current and ex-Automattician share that rosy point of view. Antimattic is an anonymous blog that allows ex-Automattic employees to vent their feelings about what used to be their workplace. One recent post on that blog raises a fascinating question about distributed (or work from home, or remote) companies. "[Is Distributed Work a Divide and Conquer Strategy](http://antimattic.blog/index.php/2020/05/26/divide-and-conquer/)?" I have to admit that I haven't thought about this perspective before. It looks like we will see more and more companies switching to remote work. It's an interesting interpretation of the "[future of work](https://gorelik.net/2020/05/26/book-review-the-year-without-pants-wordpress-com-and-the-future-of-work-by-scott-berkun/)."

> Obviously this site exists because people have had negative experiences at Automattic. But many people have also had very positive experiences at the company. Could it be that the distributed nature of Automattic allows for such varying experiences? 45 more words
