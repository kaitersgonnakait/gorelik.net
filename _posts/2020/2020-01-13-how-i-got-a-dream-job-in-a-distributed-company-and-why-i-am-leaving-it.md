One night, in January 2014, I came back home from work after spending two hours commuting in each direction. I was frustrated and started Googling for "work from home" companies. After a couple of minutes, I arrived at [https://automattic.com/work-with-us/](https://href.li/?https://automattic.com/work-with-us/). Surprisingly to me, I couldn't find any job postings for data scientists, and a quick LinkedIn search revealed no data scientists at Automattic. So I decided to write a somewhat arrogant letter titled "Why you should call me?". After reading the draft, I decided that it was too arrogant and kept it in my Drafts folder so that I can sleep over it. A couple of days later, I decided to delete that mail. HOWEVER, entirely unintentionally, I hit the send button. That's how I became the first data scientist hired by Automattic (Carly Staumbach, the data scientist and the [musician](https://colormath.bandcamp.com/releases), was already Automattician, but she arrived there by an acquisition).

The email is pretty long.  
I even forgot to remove a link that I planned to read BEFORE sending that email.

The past five and a half years have been the best five and a half years in my professional life. I met a TON of fascinating people from different cultural and professional backgrounds. I [re-discovered blogging](https://href.li/?https://gorelik.net). My idea of what a workplace is has changed tremendously and for good.

## What happened?

Until now, every time I left a workplace, I did that for external reasons. I simply had to. I left either due to company's poor financial situation, due to long commute time, or both. Now, it's the first time I am leaving a place of work entirely for internal reasons: despite, and maybe a little bit because, the fact that everything was so good. (Of course, there are some problems and disruptions, but nothing is ideal, right?)

What happened? In June, I left for a sabbatical. The sabbatical was so good that I already started making plans for another one. However, I also started thinking about my professional growth, the opportunities I have, and the opportunities I previously missed. I realized that right now, I am in the ideal position to exit the comfort zone and to take calculated professional risks. That's how, after about four sleepless weeks, I decided to quit my dream job and to start a freelance career.

On January 22, I will become an Automattic alumnus.

BTW, Automattic is constantly looking for new people. Visit their [careers page](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/) and see whether there is something for you. And if not, find the chutzpah and write them anyhow.
