TL;DR Nice'n'easy reading for novice managers

[![](/assets/images/2020/12/image-6.png?w=666)](https://www.amazon.com/MANAGER-SHORTS-shocking-management-leadership-ebook/dp/B08CPFRKRW)

I read [this book](https://www.amazon.com/MANAGER-SHORTS-shocking-management-leadership-ebook/dp/B08CPFRKRW) after hearing the author, Gal Zellermayer, in a podcast. Gal is an Israeli guy who has been working as a manager in several global companies' Israeli offices. He brings a perspective that combines (what is perceived) the best practices of American managing style with the Israeli tendency to make things straight and simple. 

The greater part of the book is devoted to helping the people in your team develop. The book serves as a good motivator and helps to keep the importance of "peopleware." I wish, however, it would bring more practical advice and cite more research and external analyses. 

## Should you read this book?

If you are a beginning manager or want to be one - yes. 

If you never read a book on management - maybe (although [Peopleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams) might be a better read).

The bottom line: 4/5
