Do you sometimes Google for something only to find stuff written by yourself?<br>I teach a course called "data-based decision making." While googling for examples of statistics misuse, I stumbled upon an interesting blog post that I wrote about one and a half years ago.

"Sunday grumpiness" is an SFW translation of Hebrew phrase that describes the most common state of mind people experience on their first work weekday. My grumpiness causes procrastination. Today, I tried to steer this procrastination to something more productive, so I searched for some statistics-related terms and stumbled upon a couple of interesting links in which people bitch about p-values.

"[Why it burns when you P](http://biofinysics.blogspot.com/2014/02/why-it-burns-when-you-p.html)" is a five-years-old rant about P values. It's funny, informative and easy to read

"[Everything Wrong With P-Values Under One Roof](http://wmbriggs.com/public/Briggs.EverthingWrongWithPvalues.pdf)" is a recent rant about p-values written in a form of a scientific paper. William M. Briggs, the author of this paper, ends it with an encouraging statement: "No, confidence intervals are not better. That for another day."

"[Everything wrong with statistics (and how to fix it)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be2wuOaglFY)" is a one-hour video lecture by Dr. Kristin Lennox who talks about the same problems. I saw this video, and two more talks by Dr. Lennox on a flight I highly recommend all her videos on YouTube.

"[Do You Hate Statistics as Much as Everyone Else?](https://flowingdata.com/2008/12/15/do-you-hate-statistics-as-much-as-everyone-else/)" -- A Natan Yau's (from flowingdata.com) attempt to get thoughtful comments from his knowledgeable readers.

This list will not be complete without the classics:

"[Why Most Published Research Findings Are False](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/)", "[Mindless Statistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535704000927)", and "[Cargo Cult Science](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm)". If you haven't read these three pieces of wisdom, you absolutely should, they will change the way you look at numbers and research.
