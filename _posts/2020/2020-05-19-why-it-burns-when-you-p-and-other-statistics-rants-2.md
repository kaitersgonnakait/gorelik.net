Do you sometimes Google for something only to find stuff written by yourself?<br>I teach a course called "data-based decision making." While googling for examples of statistics misuse, I stumbled upon an interesting blog post that I wrote about one and a half years ago.

The post is so good; I decided to post it again.

------------------------------

"Sunday grumpiness" is an SFW translation of Hebrew phrase that describes the most common state of mind people experience on their first work weekday. My grumpiness causes procrastination. Today, I tried to steer this procrastination to something more productive, so I searched for some statistics-related terms and stumbled upon a couple of interesting links in which people bitch about p-values.

"[Why it burns when you P](http://biofinysics.blogspot.com/2014/02/why-it-burns-when-you-p.html)" is a five-years-old rant about P values. It's funny, informative and easy to read

"[Everything Wrong With P-Values Under One Roof](http://wmbriggs.com/public/Briggs.EverthingWrongWithPvalues.pdf)" is a recent rant about p-values written in a form of a scientific paper. William M. Briggs, the author of this paper, ends it with an encouraging statement: "No, confidence intervals are not better. That for another day."

"[Everything wrong with statistics (and how to fix it)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be2wuOaglFY)" is a one-hour video lecture by Dr. Kristin Lennox who talks about the same problems. I saw this video, and two more talks by Dr. Lennox on a flight I highly recommend all her videos on YouTube. 

"[Do You Hate Statistics as Much as Everyone Else?](https://flowingdata.com/2008/12/15/do-you-hate-statistics-as-much-as-everyone-else/)" - A Natan Yau's (from flowingdata.com) attempt to get thoughtful comments from his knowledgeable readers. 

This list will not be complete without the classics:

"[Why Most Published Research Findings Are False](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/)", "[Mindless Statistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535704000927)", and "[Cargo Cult Science](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm)". If you haven't read these three pieces of wisdom, you absolutely should, they will change the way you look at numbers and research.

*The literal meaning of שביזות יום א is Sunday dick-brokenness.
