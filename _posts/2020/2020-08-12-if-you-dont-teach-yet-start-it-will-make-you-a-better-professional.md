Many people know me as a data scientist. However, I also teach, which is sort of unnoticed to many of my friends and colleagues. I created a [page dedicated to my teaching activity](https://gorelik.net/teaching/). Talk to me if you want to organize a course or a workshop.

I also highly recommend teaching as way of learning. So, if you don't teach yet, start! It will make you a better professional.
