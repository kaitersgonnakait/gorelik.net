OK, so Stephen Wolfram (a mega celebrity in the computational intelligence world and, among other things a physicist) claims that he may have found a path to the Fundamental Theory of Physics. The blog post is long, and I hope to be able to finish reading it in a week or two. The accompanying technical text is a 450-page tome available on a [dedicated site](https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/).

Also, it turns out that Stephen Wolfram has a [Twitch.tv channel](https://www.twitch.tv/stephen_wolfram) in which he talks about science.
