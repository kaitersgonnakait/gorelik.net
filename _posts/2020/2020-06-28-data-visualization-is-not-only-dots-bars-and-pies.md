Look at this wonderful piece of data visualization (taken from [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glycodisplay-aps_covid19-sarscov2a-coronavirus-activity-6679035232391311360-7V8y)). If you know the terms "tertiary structure" and "glycan", there is NO way you miss the message that the author of this figure wanted to convey.

Also, note how using appropriate colors in the title, the authors got rid of graph legend.
