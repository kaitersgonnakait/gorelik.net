I suppose that you knot that THE software developement Q&A site hasÂ [its own job board](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs). I suspected that the Corona pandemic would lead to a sharp decrease in the number of job postings on that board. I scraped the data, and it looks like for now, there are no drastic changes in the amount of postings published in the last couple of days.
