Slope charts are often suggested as a valid alternative to clustered bar charts, especially for "before and after" cases. 

So, instead of a clustered bar char like this

we tend to recommend a slope chart (or slope graph) like this

However, a slope chart isn't free of problems either. In the past, I already wrote about a case of a meaningless slopegraph [[here](https://gorelik.net/2018/06/20/meaningless-slopes/)].  Today, I stumbled upon an interesting blog post (and a video) that surveys the problems of slope chars and their alternatives

All the graphs here come from the original post by Nick Desbarats that can be found [[here](https://www.practicalreporting.com/blog/2020/10/17/the-problem-with-slope-charts)].
