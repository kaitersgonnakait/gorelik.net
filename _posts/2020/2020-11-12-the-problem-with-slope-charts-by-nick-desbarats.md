Slope charts are often suggested as a valid alternative to clustered bar charts, especially for "before and after" cases.

So, instead of a clustered bar char like this


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":3697,"width":null,"height":null,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/assets/img/2020/11/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3697" width="NaN" height="NaN"></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
we tend to recommend a slope chart (or slope graph) like this 


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":3699,"width":220,"height":230,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="/assets/img/2020/11/image-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3699" width="220" height="230"></figure>

However, a slope chart isn't free of problems either. In the past, I already wrote about a case of a meaningless slopegraph [[here](https://gorelik.net/2018/06/20/meaningless-slopes/)].  Today, I stumbled upon an interesting blog post (and a video) that surveys the problems of slope chars and their alternatives

All the graphs here come from the original post by Nick Desbarats that can be found [[here](https://www.practicalreporting.com/blog/2020/10/17/the-problem-with-slope-charts)].
