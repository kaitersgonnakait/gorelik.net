I am glad and proud to announce that a paper which I helped to prepare and publish is [available on the Nature's group site](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-020-0544-4.epdf?author_access_token=RXMXSRvoJWIqxNm4TTTGm9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0N6F0ImkFYs8yHy8-dut4O8nM-qc-1iv3UbWYKoXALUQv8giNE6RrCUHjE-vKYFJOx9MuFUBpaArgVeNnOkZuzjNYwBtm19ZkWl3DveeFUTPA%3D%3D).

The paper, The cardiovascular safety of antiobesity drugs—analysis of signals in the FDA Adverse Event Report System Database, by Einat Gorelik et al. (including myself) analyzes the data in the [FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/questions-and-answers-fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers-public-dashboard). In this study, we found interesting and relevant safety information about the long-term safety of the antiobesity drug Lorcaserin. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the paper, the review process took about a year. Interestingly enough, the FDA requested the withdrawal of Lorcaserin due to long-term safety issues but not the ones we studied.
