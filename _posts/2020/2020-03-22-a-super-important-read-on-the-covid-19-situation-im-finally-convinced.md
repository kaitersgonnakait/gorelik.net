Until now I was very sceptical about the COVID-19 measures taken by many the governments around the world, especially the Israeli one. Today, finally, I read a post that addressed the three issues I was pointing to:

1. This first lockdown will last for months, which seems unacceptable for many people.
2. A months-long lockdown would destroy the economy.
3. It wouldn’t even solve the problem, because we would be just postponing the epidemic: later on, once we release the social distancing measures, people will still get infected in the millions and die.
4. **My biggest concern**: Either a lot of people die soon and we don’t hurt the economy today, or we hurt the economy today, just to postpone the deaths.

There's no point rephrasing here the original post, [just go and read it](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56). I'm convinced. Thank you, Tomas Pueyo
