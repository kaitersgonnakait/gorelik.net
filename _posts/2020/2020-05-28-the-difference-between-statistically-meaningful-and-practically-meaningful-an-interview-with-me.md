Recently, I gave an [interview to the Techie Leadership](https://techieleadership.com/the-difference-between-statistically-meaningful-and-practically-meaningful-with-boris-gorelik-009/) site. Andrei Crudu, the interviewer, made a helpful outline of the conversation. I marked the most important parts in bold.

 Academic views on leadership;
 Managing people isn’t for everyone;
 Lessons from a practical approach;
 Data Science is predominantly about data cleaning;
 **The difference between statistically meaningful and practically meaningful;**
 How sometimes companies tweak results to match expectations;
 Bad managers make you appreciate the good managers;
 **Giving credit, being decent and not cheating;**
 All good teamwork starts with effective communication;
 **You don’t know that the stuff that you know is unknown to others;**


Overall, I enjoyed chatting with Andrei, and I hope you'll enjoy listening to the interview.
