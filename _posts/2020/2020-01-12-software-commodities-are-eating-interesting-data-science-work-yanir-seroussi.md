If you read my shortish post about staying employable as a data scientist, you might like a longer post by a colleague, Yanir Seroussi. In his post, Yanir lists four possible paths for a data scientist: (1) become an engineer; (2) reinvent the wheel; (3) search for niches; and (4) expand the cutting edge.

To this list, I would also add two other options.

**(5) Manage.** Managing is not developing, it's a different profession. However, some developers and data scientists that I know choose this path. I am not a manager myself, so I hope I don't insult the managers who read these lines, but I think that it is much easier for a good manager to stay good, than for a good developer or data scientist.

**(6) Teach.** I teach as a part-time job. One reason for teaching is that I sometimes enjoy it. Another reason is that I feel that at some point, I might not be good enough to stay on the cutting edge but still sharp enough to teach the new generations the basics.  

Anyhow, read Yanir's post linked below.
