If you read my shortish post about staying employable as a data scientist, you might like a longer post by a colleague, Yanir Seroussi.

**(6) Teach.** I teach as a part-time job. One reason for teaching is that I sometimes enjoy it. Another reason is that I feel that at some point, I might not be good enough to stay on the cutting edge but still sharp enough to teach the new generations the basics.<br>
