I've stumbled upon an exciting project -- [text visualization browser](https://textvis.lnu.se/). It's a web page that allows one to search for different text visualization techniques using keywords and publication time.

The ability to limit the search to various years gives a nice historical perspective on this interesting topic

This site's information is based on a 2015 paper [Text visualization techniques: Taxonomy, visual survey, and community insights](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7156366). I wish the authors updated it with more recent data, though.
