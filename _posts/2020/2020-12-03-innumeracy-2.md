Innumeracy is the "inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance".<br>I wish there was a better term for "innumeracy", a term that would reflect the importance of analyzing risks, uncertainty, and chance. Unfortunately, I can't find such a term. Nevertheless, the problem is huge. In this long post, Tom Breur reviews many important aspects of "numeracy". I already shared this post a long time ago, but it's worth sharing again.
