Today, I read a [post about Ziph's law and Alzheimer's disease](https://akshaybudhkar.com/2017/10/16/zipfs-law-apply-alzheimers/). I liked the post very much and decided to press the "like" button only to discover that I already "liked" this post more than two years ago.

Indeed this is an interesting post.
