In technical communication, the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing. There are multiple ways to ensure this principle. Some of these ways require careful chart fine-tuning. However, there is one tool that is easy to master, fast to apply, and that provides a high return on the investment rate. I refer to chart titles. In this talk, I had two main theses. My first thesis is that most of you suck in communication (and not only data visualization).

My second thesis is that you can quickly improve your graphs by merely adding a good title. The importance of good titles is [not new to my preaching](https://gorelik.net/2018/06/25/c-for-conclusion/), but I thought it was an excellent thing to formalize this thesis a bit, and I'm thankful to the NDR organizers for giving me this opportunity.
