I'm sorting my teaching material, and I found this gem. The UK Government Statistical Service published a guideline for effective data visualization and tables. If you know a busy person who doesn't have time to study data visualization and can only read one document, this document is for them (it has less than 40 pages full of examples). Click o the image above to go to the guideline
