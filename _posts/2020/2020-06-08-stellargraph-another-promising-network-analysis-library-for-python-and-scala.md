Network (graph) analysis is a complicated topic. There are several tools available for this task with different pros and cons. Recently, I stumbled upon another tool StellarGraph. StellarGraph authors claim to provide excellent performance; NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow integration, an impressive set of algorithms, inter compatibility with Neo4j (THE graph database); and much more.Â The [documentation](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) looks very clear and extensive too. 

I didn't use it yet, but I certainly plan to.
