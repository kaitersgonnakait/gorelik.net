TL;DR Very shallow and uninformative. It could be an OK series of blog posts for complete novices, but not a book.

[The Persuasion Slide by Richard Dooley](https://www.amazon.in/Persuasion-Slide-Customers-Unconscious-Psychology-ebook/dp/B01CPKYDKU) was a disappointment for me. I love Dooley's podcast [Brainfluence](https://www.rogerdooley.com/category/podcast/), and I was sure that Richard's book would full of in-depth knowledge and case studies. However, it contained neither.

The only contribution of this book is the analogy between a sale process and an amusement part slide. The theory behind the book is mostly presented as a ground truth with almost no explanation or support from research. One will gain much more knowledge and understanding by reading Kahneman's "[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)," Arieli's "[Predictably irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational)." or Weisman's "[59 seconds](https://www.amazon.com/59-Seconds-Change-Under-Minute/dp/0307474860)."
