More than two years ago, I took a look at Google Trends for three phrases "start a blog", "create a blog", and  "create a site". [I was surprised by the high volume of blog searches, compared to "create a site"](https://gorelik.net/2018/02/26/blogging-isnt-what-it-used-to-be/).

Today, I decided to go back to Google Trends and to add the [new rising star](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=create%20a%20blog,start%20a%20blog,create%20a%20site,start%20a%20podcast): podcasting.

It looks like podcasting starts its exponential growth, while the blogging continues its slow but steady decline. I will be unsurprised if, in 2022, the green, podcasting line will surpass the other lines in this graph. Let's wait and see.
