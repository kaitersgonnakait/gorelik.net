A data giraffe is a situation where a very prominent data point shades everything else. I learned this term from a [post by Pini Yakuel](https://www.optimove.com/blog/beware-the-giraffes-in-your-data) and immediately liked it a lot.

Dealing with data giraffes is hard, especially when dealing with bar charts. Today I saw one interesting approach to this problem

Katherine S. Rowell is a co-funder of a Boston firm that specializes in data visualization. In December, she published a [post dedicated to one of the most popular but also most abused graph types, the bar charts](http://ksrowell.com/blog-visualizing-data/2019/12/18/bar-humbug/). One of the examples in her post demonstrates a nice treatment of data giraffes

In this example, Katherine draws the graph twice. The zoomed-out version shows the giraffes in all their glory, while the zoomed-in one gives the spotlight to the foxes, hyenas, and mice.  
Also, note how these graphs respect the rules that every bar chart has to include the zero.
