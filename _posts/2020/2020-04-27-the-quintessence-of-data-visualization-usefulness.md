I have to admit, I was skeptical at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. I started becoming skeptical now when it seems that the crisis didn't hit my country too hard. But then I saw the graphs in this [Financial Times article](https://www.ft.com/content/6bd88b7d-3386-4543-b2e9-0d5c6fac846c), and the skepticism disapeared. The graphs are accompanied by hundreds of words, but there is no need for reading the text to understand almost everything.

These graphs are so good, so convincing, so well performed, they don't leave any place for doubt or misunderstanding of the message the author wants to convey.

If you study data visualization, look at these graphs. Look at the color choice, legend location, and design. Look at the ticks on the X and Y-axes, how they are spaced and typeset. Note the amount of details on the axes, specifically how sparse these details are.
