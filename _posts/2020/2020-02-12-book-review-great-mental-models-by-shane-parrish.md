TL;DR shallow and disappointing 


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
[The Great Mental Models](https://fs.blog/tgmm/) by Shane Parrish [was highly praised](https://ma.tt/2019/11/farnam-streets-great-mental-models-presented-by-automattic/) by Automattic's CEO Matt Mullenweg. Since I appreciate Matt's opinion a lot, I  decided to buy the book. I read it and was disappointed.

This book is very ambitious but yet shallow and non-engaging. If you consider reading a book on mental models, then chances are you already know some of them. I expected the book to shed light on aspects I didn't know or didn't think of. Nothing like that happened. I didn't learn new facts, neither was I impressed by a new way of thinking. I also think that this book won't do the job with teenagers who still don't have the arsenal of mental models, for them this book is full of unclear shortcuts.

The book is based on the materials of a highly praised blog [fs.blog](https://fs.blog/) and is a good example how  some stuff can work well as a blog post but feel bad as a book.

The bottom line: 2/5 Skip it.
