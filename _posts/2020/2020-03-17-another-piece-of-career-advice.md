Here's another email that I got with the question about switching to the data science career<br>

> Hello, my name is X. I saw your blog, and to be honest, I said, "Wow, is this me :)" I'm a pharmacist 5th-grade student currently working on a project in computational drug design. I started programming, and I loved it. After that, I heard the term "Data Science" and started to do some research […]
> <br><br>
> Basically, I loved being on a computer and solving problems its a good career option for me (at least for now, you can't predict future) my mom has a pharmacy I worked there (internship), and it is not for me (i am counting the time when I'm in a pharmacy.) so I have a few questions for you
> <br><br>
> I don't have any degree in statistics or CS or something equivalent I am determined to learn these topics, but some people want to see the degree, and probably no one accept a pharmacist to a master degree in statistics (I also wish to do my Ms in computational drug design because, in the end, I don't want to be a data scientist in social sciences or economics, at least for now, I want to use that knowledge in my field which is drugs and pharmaceuticals)
> <br><br>
> Ph.D. on Bioinformatics would help ? or Biostatistics ( is it easier for us to be accepted in biostatistics rather than statistics? To be honest, I don't know the difference much, I took a biostatistics class, but it was just one semester and probably not enough for Ph.D. :))
> <br><br>
> Do I really need a degree in CS or statistics to be a pharmaceutical data scientist? I want to do my Ph.D. but also want to be realistic, it sounds amazing doing online masters in statistics while you are doing Computational drug design or Bİoinformatics Ph.D., but it is very hard and frustrating and also decrease your productivity in both fields.
> <br><br>
> I asked a lot of questions, sorry, but I have many :). You can reply when you have time. Thank you, and I loved your blog. I read and watched tons of things, but yours was the best suited for me because being a pharmacist, computational drug design, considering bioinformatics, it is all fits. By the way, I also considering cybersecurity (not working in a company but learning). I see that as a "martial arts of the future," maybe I am wrong, but a person should know it to protect him/her self. Thank you again :)

Indeed, X's background sounds very much like mine.<br>I'm not sure I have too much to add to what I already wrote here, in this blog. The only thing that I have to say is that in my biased opinion, a Ph.D. is something worth pursuing. The more time passes by, the more Ph.Ds there are, and the lack of a degree might be a problem in the future job market. On the other hand, there are many smart and rich people who claim that university degrees are a waste of time. Go figure :-)

I hope that this helps.
