The first lesson of the course [Data Visualization Beyond the Tutorial](https://gorelik.net/course/) is online! Go to the [lesson page](https://gorelik.net/course/data-visualization-what-why-and-how/) to watch the lesson video. There's also an assignment!

Do you know a friend, a colleague, a classmate who needs to communicate numbers as part of their works? Let them know about this course. They will thank you :-)
