Here's an old joke:

Canine behavior aside, the fact that you can do something doesn't mean that you **should** to it. I already wrote about one such example, when I [compared between chart legends to muttonchops](https://gorelik.net/2017/04/12/chart-legends-and-the-muttonchops/).

Citing myself:

> Chart legends are like Muttonchops — the fact that you can have them doesn’t mean you should.

Stay tuned and check the [because-you-can](https://gorelik.net/tag/because-you-can/ tag) tag.
