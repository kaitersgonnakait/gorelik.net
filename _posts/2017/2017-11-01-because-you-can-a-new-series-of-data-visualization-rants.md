Here's an old joke:

> Q: Why do dogs lick their balls? A: Because they can.

Canine behavior aside, the fact that you can do something doesn't mean that you **should** to it. I already wrote about one such example, when I [compared between chart legends to muttonchops](https://gorelik.net/2017/04/12/chart-legends-and-the-muttonchops/).

Citing myself:

> Chart legends are like Muttonchops — the fact that you can have them doesn’t mean you should.

When reviewing my notes, I realized that I have more bad data visualization examples that share a common problem: effortless addition of elements or features.

Stay tuned and check the [because-you-can](https://gorelik.net/tag/because-you-can/ tag) tag.
