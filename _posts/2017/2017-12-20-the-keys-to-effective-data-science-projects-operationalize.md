Recently, I've stumbled upon an interesting [series of posts about effective management of data science projects](https://buckwoody.wordpress.com//?s=The+Keys+to+Effective+Data+Science+Projects+&search=Go).  One of the posts in the series [says](https://buckwoody.wordpress.com/2017/10/12/the-keys-to-effective-data-science-projects-part-8-operationalize/):

The main claim of that post is that, at some point, bringing actual users to your data science project may be more important than improving the model. This is exactly what I meant in my "[when good enough is good enough](http://gorelik.net/2017/06/12/time-series-analysis-when-good-enough-is-good-enough/)" post (also [available on YouTube](http://gorelik.net/2017/08/14/anomaly-detection-in-time-series-now-the-video/))
