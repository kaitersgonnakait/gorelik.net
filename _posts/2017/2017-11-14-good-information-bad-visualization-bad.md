I went through my [Machine Learning tag feed](https://wordpress.com/tag/machine-learning). Suddenly, I stumbled upon a pie chart that looked so terrible, I was sure the post would be about bad practices in data visualization. I was wrong. The chart was there to convey some information. The problem is that it is bad in so many ways. It is very hard to appreciate the information in a post that shows charts like that. Especially when the post talks about data science that relies so much on data visualization.

I would write a post about good practices in pie charts, but Robert Kosara, of https://eagereyes.org does this so well, I don't really think I need to reinvent the weel. Pie charts are very powerful in conveying information. Make sure you use this tool well. I strongly suggest reading [everything Robert Kosara has to say on this topic](https://eagereyes.org/?s=pie+chart).
