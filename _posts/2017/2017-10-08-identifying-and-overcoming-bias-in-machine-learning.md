Data scientists build models using data. Real-life data captures real-life injustice and stereotypes. Are data scientists observers whose job is to describe the world, no matter how unjust it is?

Read the [latest data.blog post](https://data.blog/2017/10/04/data-speaker-series-charles-earl-on-discriminatory-artificial-intelligence/) to learn Charles' arguments and best practices.
