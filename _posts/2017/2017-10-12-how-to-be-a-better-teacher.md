If you know me in person or follow my blog, you know that I have a keen interest in teaching. Indeed, besides being a full-time data scientist at Automattic, I teach data visualization anywhere I can. Since I started teaching, I became much better in communication, which is one of the required skills of a good data scientist.
In my constant strive for improving what I do, I joined the Data Carpentry instructor training. Recently, I got my certification as a data carpentry instructor.

Software Carpentry (and it's sibling project [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)) aims to teach researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. "Carpentry" instructors are volunteers who receive a pretty extensive training and who are committed to evidence-based teaching techniques. The instructor training had a powerful impact on how I approach teaching. If teaching is something that you do or plan to do, invest three hours of your life watching this video in which Greg Wilson, "Carpentries" founder, talks about evidence-based teaching and his "Carpentries" project.

I also recommend reading these papers, which provide a brief overview of some evidence-based results in teaching:


     "[The Science of Learning](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf)"

     "[Success in Introductory Programming: What Works?](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/porter-what-works-2013.pdf)"

     "[What Can I Do Today to Create a More Inclusive Community in CS?](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/lee-create-inclusive-community-2015.pdf)"
