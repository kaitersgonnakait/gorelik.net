I teach data visualization to in Azrieli College of Engineering in Jerusalem. Yesterday, during my first lesson, I was talking about the different ways a chart design selection can lead to different conclusions, despite not affecting the actual data. One of the students hypothesized that the preception of a figure can change as a function of other graphs shown together. Which was exactly tested in a research I recently [mentioned here](http://gorelik.net/2017/10/17/can-the-order-in-which-graphs-are-shown-change-peoples-conclusions/). I felt very proud of that student, despite only meeting them one hour before that.
