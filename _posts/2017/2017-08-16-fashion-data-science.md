Zalando is an e-commerce company that sells shoes, clothing and other fashion items. Zalando isn't a small company. According to Wikipedia, it's 2015 revenue was almost [3 billion Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalando). As you might imagine, you don't run this kind of business without proper data analysis. Recently, we had [Thorsten Dietzsch](https://de.linkedin.com/in/thorsten-dietzsch-aaaa6b63), a product manager for personalization at the fashion e-commerce at Zalando, joining our team meeting to tell us about how data science works at Zalando. It was an interesting conversation, which is now publically available online.
