On June 12th, I'll be talking about anomaly detection and future forecasting when "good enough" is good enough. This lecture is a part of PyCon Israel that takes place between June 11 and 14 in the Bar Ilan University. The [conference agenda](http://il.pycon.org/wwwpyconIL/agenda) is very impressive. If "python" or "data" are parts of your professional life, come to this conference!
