Someone asked me about distributed companies or companies that offer remote positions. Of course, my first response was Automattic but that person  didn't think that Automattic was a good fit for them. So I googled and was surprised to discover that my colleague, [Yanir Seroussi](http://yanirseroussi.com/), maintains a [list of companies that offer remote jobs](https://github.com/yanirs/established-remote).

I work at Automattic, one of the biggest distributed-only companies in the world (if not the biggest one). Recently, Automattic founder and CEO, Matt Mullenweg started a new podcast called (surprise) [Distributed](https://distributed.blog/podcast/).
