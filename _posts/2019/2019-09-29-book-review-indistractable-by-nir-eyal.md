Nir Eyal is known for his book "Hooked" in which he teaches how to create addictive products. In his new book "[Indistractable](https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable/)", Nir teaches how to live in the world full of addictive products. The book itself isn't bad. It provides interesting information and, more importantly, practical tips and action items. Nir covers topics such as digital distraction, productivity and procrastination.

I liked the fact that the author "gives permission" to spend time on Facebook, Instagram, Youtube etc, as long as it is what you planned to do. Paraphrasing Nir, distraction isn't distraction unless you know what it distracts you from. In other words, anything you do is a potential distraction unless you know what, why and when you are doing it. 

 My biggest problem with this book is that I already knew almost everything that Nir wrote. Maybe I already read too many similar books and articles, maybe I'm just that smart (not really) but for me, most of Indistractable wasn't valuable. 

Until I got to the chapter that deals with raising children ("Part 6, how to raise indistractable children"). I have to admit, when it comes to speaking about raising kids in the digital era, Nir is a refreshing voice. He doesn't join the global hysteria of "the screens make zombies of our kids". Moreover, Nir brings a nice collection of hysterical prophecies from the 15th, 18th and 20th centuries in which "experts" warned about the bad influence new inventions  (such as printed books, affordable education, radio) had on the kids.

Another nice touch is the fact that each chapter has a short summary that consists of three-four bullet points. Even nicer is the fact that Nir copied all the "Remember this" lists at the end of the book, which is very kind of him.

The Bottom line. 4/ Read.
