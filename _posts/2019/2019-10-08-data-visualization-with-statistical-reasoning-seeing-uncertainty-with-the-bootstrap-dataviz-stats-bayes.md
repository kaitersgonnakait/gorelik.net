On Sunday, I [wrote about bootstrapping](https://gorelik.net/2019/10/06/bootstrapping-the-right-way/). On Monday, I [wrote about visualization uncertainty](https://gorelik.net/2019/10/07/error-bars-in-bar-charts-you-probably-shouldnt/). Let's now talk about bootstrapping and uncertainty visualization.

Robert Grant is a data visualization expert who wrote a [book about interactive data visualization](http://www.robertgrantstats.co.uk/dataviz-book.html) (which I should read, BTW). 

Robert runs an interesting blog from which I learned another approach to uncertainty visualization, bootstrapping.
