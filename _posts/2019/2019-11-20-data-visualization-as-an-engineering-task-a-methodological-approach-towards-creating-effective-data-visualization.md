In June 2019, I attended the NDR AI conference in Ia»ôi, Romania where I also gave a talk. Recently, the organizers uploaded the video recording to YouTube.

That was a very interesting conference, tight with interesting talks.

Next year, I plan to attend the Bucharest edition of NDR, where I will also give a talk with the working title "The biggest missed opportunity in data visualization"
