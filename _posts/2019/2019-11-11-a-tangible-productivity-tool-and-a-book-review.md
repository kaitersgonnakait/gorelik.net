One month ago, I stumbled upon a book called "[Personal Kanban: Mapping Work | Navigating Life](https://amzn.to/33DM4l4)" by Jim Benson (all the book links use my affiliate code). Never before, I saw a more significant discrepancy between the value that the book gave me and its actual content.

Even before finishing the first chapter of this book, I realized that I wanted to incorporate "personal kanban" into my productivity system. The problem was that the entire book could be summarized by a blog post or by a Youtube video (such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG6IDTHJ-bg)). The rest of the book contains endless repetitions and praises. I recommend **not** reading this book, even though it strongly affected the way I work

So, what is Personal Kanban anyhow? Kanban is a productivity approach that puts all the tasks in front of a person on a whiteboard. Usually, Kanban boards are physical boards with post-it notes, but software Kanban boards are also widely known (Trello is one of them). Following are the claims that Jim Benson makes in his book that resonated with me

- Many productivity approaches view personal and professional life separately. The reality is that these two aspects of our lives are not separate at all. Therefore, a productivity method needs to combine them.
- Having all the critical tasks in front of your eyes helps to get the global picture. It also helps to group the tasks according to their contexts. 
- The act of moving notes from one place to another gives valuable tangible feedback. This feedback has many psychological benefits.
- One should limit the number of work-in-progress tasks.
- There are three different types of "productivity." You are Productive when you work hard. You are Efficient when your work is actually getting done. Finally, you are Effective when you do the right job at the right time, and can repeat this process if needed. 

I'm a long user of a productivity method that I adopted from [Mark Forster](http://markforster.squarespace.com/). You may read about my process [here](https://gorelik.net/2018/02/20/the-best-productivity-system-i-know/). Having read Personal Kanban, I decided to combine it with my approach. According to the plan, I have more significant tasks on my Kanban board, which I use to make daily, weekly, and long-term plans. For the day-to-day (and hour-to-hour) taks, I still use my notebooks. 

Initially, I used my whiteboard for this purpose, but something wasn't right about it.

Having my Kanban on my home office whiteboard had two significant drawbacks. First, the whiteboard isn't with me all the time. And what is the point of putting your tasks on board if you can't see it? Secondly, listing everything on a whiteboard has some privacy issues. After some thoughts, I decided to migrate the Kanban to my notebook.

In this notebook, I have two spreads. The first spread is used for the backlog, and "this week" taks. The second spread has the "today," "doing," "wait," and "done" columns. The fact that the notebook is smaller than the whiteboard turned out to be a useful feature. This physical limitation limits the number of tasks I put on my "today" and "doing" lists. 

I organize the tasks at the beginning of my working day. The rest of the system remains unchanged. After more than a month, I'm happy with this new tangible productivity method.
