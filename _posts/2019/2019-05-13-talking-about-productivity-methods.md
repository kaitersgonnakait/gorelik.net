> The best way to procrastinate is to research productivity.
> 
> <cite>Boris Gorelik</cite>


This week, the majority of Automattic Data Division meets in person in Vienna. During one of the sessions I presented [my productivity method](https://gorelik.net/2018/02/20/the-best-productivity-system-i-know/) to my friends and coworkers.

Presenting this method was a fun and enjoyable experience for me. I decided to try doing this again, in a more formal and structured way. If you know of a productivity-oriented meetups that might be interested in hearing me, let me know.

### Some post-talk notes

It turns out that the method Iâ€™m using much closer to Mark Forster's "[Final Version](http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109511856508.html)" than to his AutoFocus 

During the years, Mark Forster created and tested many time management approaches. Scan through this page [http://markforster.squarespace.com/tm-systems](http://markforster.squarespace.com/tm-systems) to find something that might work for you to find something that might work for you.
