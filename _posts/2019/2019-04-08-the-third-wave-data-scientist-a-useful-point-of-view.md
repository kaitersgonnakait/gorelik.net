In 2019, it's hard to find a data-related blogger who doesn't write about the essence and the future of data science as a profession. Most of these posts (like this one for example) are mostly useless both for existing data scientists who think about their professional plans and for people who consider data science as their career.

Today I saw yet another post which I find very useful. In this post, Dominik Haitz identifies a "[third wave data scientist](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-third-wave-data-scientist-1421df7433c9)." In Dominik's opinion, a successful data scientist has to combine four features: (1) Business mindset (2) Software engineering craftsmanship (3) Statistics and algorithmic toolbox, and (4) Soft skills. In Dominik's classification, the business mindset is not "another skill" but the central pillar.

The professional challenges that I have been facing during the past eighteen months or so, made me realize the importance of points 1, 2, and 3 from Dominik's list (number 4 was already very important on my personal list). However, it took reading his post to put the puzzle parts in place.

Dominik's additional contribution to the discussion is ditching the famous data science Venn Diagram in favor of another, "business-oriented" visual which I used as the "featured image" to this post.

A fragment from an 1850 painting by the Russian Armenian marine painter Ivan Aivazovsky named "The Ninth Wave." I wonder what the "ninth wave data scientist" will be.
