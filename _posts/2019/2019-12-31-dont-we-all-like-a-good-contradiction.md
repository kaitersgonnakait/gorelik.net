I am a huge fan of [Gerd Gigerenzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Gigerenzer) who preaches numeracy and uncertainty education. One of Prof. Gigerenzer's pivotal theses is "[Fast and Frugal Heuristics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4625029/)" which is also popularized in his book "[Gut Feelings](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/298863/gut-feelings-by-gerd-gigerenzer/)" (listen to [this podcast](https://www.econtalk.org/gerd-gigerenzer-on-gut-feelings/) if you don't want to read the book). I like this approach.

Today, I listened to the latest [episode of the Brainfluence podcast](https://www.rogerdooley.com/gleb-tsipursky-gut/) that hosted the psychologist Dr. Gleb Tsipursky who wrote an extensive book called "[Never Trust your Gut](https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/nevergut/)" with a seemingly contradicting thesis. I added this book to my TOREAD list.
