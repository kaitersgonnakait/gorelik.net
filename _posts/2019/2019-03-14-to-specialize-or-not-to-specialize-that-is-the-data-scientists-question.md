In my last [post on data science career](https://gorelik.net/2019/03/07/the-data-science-umbrella-or-should-you-study-data-science-as-a-career-move-the-2019-edition/), I heavily promoted the idea that a data scientist needs to find his or her specialization. I back my opinion with my experience and by citing other people opinions. However, keep in mind that I am not a career advisor, I never surveyed the job market, and I might not know what I'm talking about. Moreover, despite the fact that I advocate for specialization, I think that I am more of a generalist.

Since I published [the last post](https://gorelik.net/2019/03/07/the-data-science-umbrella-or-should-you-study-data-science-as-a-career-move-the-2019-edition/), I was pointed to some other posts and articles that either support or contradict my point of view. The most interesting ones are: "[Why you shouldn't be a data science generalist](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-data-science-generalist-f69ea37cdd2c)" and "[Why Data Science Teams Need Generalists, Not Specialists](https://hbr.org/2019/03/why-data-science-teams-need-generalists-not-specialists)", both are very recent and very articulated but promote different points of view. Go figure
