Not long ago, I wrote a post about a [fast hack that increased my reading speed by tracking the reading with a finger](https://gorelik.net/2019/09/19/a-fast-way-to-increase-your-reading-speed-by-25/). I think that the logic behind using a tracking finger is to suppress [subvocalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization). I noticed that, at least in my case, suppressing subvocalization reduces the fun of reading. I actually enjoy hearing the inner voice that reads the book "with me".
