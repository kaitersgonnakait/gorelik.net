I stumbled upon a [very detailed and useful summary of a recent conference on empirical methods in natural language processing](https://medium.com/@mgalkin/knowledge-graphs-nlp-emnlp-2019-part-i-e4e69fd7957c). I have to say, Michael Galkin, the author of this review, did an excellent job. His blog, [https://medium.com/@mgalkin](https://medium.com/@mgalkin), is worth following.
