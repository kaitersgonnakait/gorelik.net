As much as I love thinking that I live in a global world, most people whom I know speak Hebrew. From time to time, someone would tell me "nice post, but why not in Hebrew?". So, from now on, I will try to translate all my new posts to Hebrew. I will try. Not promising anything. My Hebrew blog lives at [https://he.gorelik.net/blog-feed](https://he.gorelik.net/blog-feed)
