[NDR](https://ndrconf.ai/) is a family of machine learning conferences in Romania. Last year, I attended the Iași edition of that conference, gave [a data visualization talk](https://gorelik.net/2019/11/20/data-visualization-as-an-engineering-task-a-methodological-approach-towards-creating-effective-data-visualization/), and enjoyed every moment. All the lectures (including mine, obviously) were interesting and relevant. That is why, when [Vlad Iliescu](https://vladiliescu.net/), one of the NDR organizers, asked me whether I wanted to talk in Bucharest at NDR 2020, I didn't think twice. 

Since the organizers didn't publish the talk topics yet, I will not ruin the surprise for you, but I promise to be interesting and relevant. I definitely think that NDR is worth the trip to Bucharest to many data practitioners, even the ones who don't live in Romania. Visit the [conference site](https://ndrconf.ai/) to register.
