The bottom line: read it but use your best judgement 4/5

I recently completed reading "[The Formula. The Universal Laws of Success" by Albert-László Barabási](http://barabasi.com/book/the-formula). Barabási is a network science professor who co-authored the "preferential attachment" paper (a.k.a. the [Barabási-Albert model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model)). People who follow him closely are ether vivid fabs or haters [accusing him of nonsense science](https://gorelik.net/2017/11/15/another-set-of-ruthless-critique-pieces/).

For several years, A-L Barabási is talking and writing about the "science of success" (yeah, I can hear some of my colleagues laughing right now). Recently, he summarized the research in this area in an easy-to-read book with the promising title "[The Formula. The Universal Laws of Success](http://barabasi.com/book/the-formula)." The main takeaways that I took from this book are:

 Success is about us, not about you. In other words, it doesn't matter how hard you work and how good your work is, if "we" (i.e., the public) don't know about it, or don't see it, or attribute it to someone else.
 Be known for your expertise. Talk passionately about your job. The people who talk about an idea will get the credit for it. Consider the following example from the book. Let's say, prof. Barabasi and the Pope write a joint scientific paper. If the article is about network science, it will be perceived as if the Pope helped Barabasi with writing an essay. If, on the other hand, if it is a theosophical book, we will immediately assume that the Pope was the leading force behind it.
 It doesn't matter how old you are; the success can come to you at any age. It is a well-known fact that most successful people broke into success at a young age. What Barabási claims is that the reason for that is not a form of ageism but the fact that the older people try less. According to this claim, as long as you are creative and work hard, your most significant success is ahead of you.
 Persistence pays. This is another claim that Barabasi makes in his book. It is related to the previous one but is based on a different set of observations (did you know that Harry Potter was rejected twelve times before it was published?). I must say that I'm very skeptical about this one. Right now, I don't have the time to explain my reasons, and I promise to write a dedicated post.


Keep in mind that the author uses academic success (the Nobel prize, citation index, etc.) as the metric for most of his conclusions. This limitation doesn't bother him, after all, Barabási is a full-time University professor, but most of us should add another grain of salt to the conclusions. 

Overall, if you find yourself thinking about your professional future, or if you are looking for a good career advice, I recommend reading this book.
