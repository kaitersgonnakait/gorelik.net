How do you properly select a colormap for a graph? What makes the [rainbow color map a wrong choice, and what are the proper alternatives?](https://gorelik.net/2020/08/17/what-is-the-biggest-problem-of-the-jet-and-rainbow-color-maps-and-why-is-it-not-as-evil-as-i-thought/)

Today, I stumbled upon a lengthy post that provides an in-depth review of the theory behind our color perception. The article concentrates on quantitative colormaps but also includes information relevant to selecting proper colors for categories.

If you never learned the theory behind the color and are interested in data visualization, I strongly suggest investing 45-60 minutes of your life in reading this post.
