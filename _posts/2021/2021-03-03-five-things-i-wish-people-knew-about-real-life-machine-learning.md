Deena Gergis is a data science lead at Bayer. I recently discovered Deena's article on LinkedIn titled "[Five Things I Wish I Knew About Real-Life AI](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-things-i-wish-knew-real-life-ai-deena-gergis/)." I think that this article is a great piece of a career advice for all the current and aspiring data scientists, as well as for all the professionals who work with them. Let' me take Deena's headings and add my 2 cents.

## One. It is all about the delivered value, not the method.


<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
I fully agree with this one. Nobody cares whether you used a linear regression or recurrent neural network. Nobody really cares about p-values or r-squared. What people need are results, insights, or working products. Simple, right?

## Two. Packaging does matter


<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Again, well said. The way you present your solution to your colleagues, customers, or stakeholders can determine whether your project will get more funds and resources or not. 


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
## Three. Doing the right things != doing things right.


<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Exactly. Citing Deena: "you might be perfectly predicting a KPI that no one cares about." Enough said. 


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
## Four. Set realistic expectations.


<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Not everybody realizes that "machine learning" and "artificial intelligence" are not a synonym of "magic" but rather a form of statistics (I hope "real" statisticians won't get mad at me here). The principle "garbage in - garbage out" holds in machine learning. Moreover, sometimes, ML systems amplify the garbage, resulting in "garbage in, tons of garbage out". 


<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
## Five. Keep humans in the loop.


<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Let me cite Deena again: "My customers are my partners, not just end-users." Note that by "customers," we don't only mean walk-in clients, but also any internal customer, project manager, even a colleague who works on the same project. They are all partners with unique insights, domain knowledge, and experience. Use them to make your work better.

Read the original article [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-things-i-wish-knew-real-life-ai-deena-gergis/). Deena Gergis has several more articles on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deena-gergis/detail/recent-activity/posts/). And if you know Arabic, you might want to watch Deena's videos on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/DeenaGergis/videos). Unfortunately, my Arabic is not good enough to understand her Egyptian accent, but I suspect that her videos are as good as her writings.
