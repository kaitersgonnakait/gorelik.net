In January 2020, I started a new experiment. [I quit what was a dream job and became a freelancer](https://gorelik.net/2020/01/13/how-i-got-a-dream-job-in-a-distributed-company-and-why-i-am-leaving-it/). Today, the experiment is over. This post serves as omphaloskepsis  a  short reflection on what went well and what could have worked better.

## What worked well?

To sum up, I declare this experiment successful. I had a chance to work with several very interesting companies. I got exposed to business models of which I wasn't aware. Most importantly, I met new intelligent and ambitious people. I also had a chance to feel by myself how it feels to be self-employed, to see the behind-the-scenes of several freelancers and entrepreneurs. I learned to appreciate the audacity and the courage of people who don't rely on monthly paychecks and take much more responsibility for their lives than the vast majority of the "salarymen."

Let's talk about money. Was it worth it in terms of \$\$\$\$\$ (or ₪₪₪₪₪₪)? Objectively speaking, my financial situation remained approximately unchanged. Towards the end of the experiment, I found myself overbooked, which means that, in theory, I could have increased my income substantially. But this is only in theory. In practice, I decided to end the freelance experiment and "settle down".

## What could have been better?

So, was it peachy? Not at all. For me, being a freelancer is much more stressful than being a hired employee. The stress does not come exclusively from the need to make sure one has enough projects in the pipeline (I had enough of them, most of the time). The more significant source of stress came from the lack of focus, the need for EXTREME context switching, and the lack of a team. 

I did receive one suggestion to mitigate this source of stress; however, when I heard it, I already had several job offers and was already 90% committed to accepting the position at MyBiotics.

## To sum up

I'm am very happy I did this experiment. I learned a lot; I enjoyed a lot (and suffered a lot too), I met new people, and I changed the way I think about many things. Was it a good idea? Yes, it was. Should **you** try becoming a freelancer? How the hell can I know that? It's your life; you enjoy the success and take the risk of failure.
