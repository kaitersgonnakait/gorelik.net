<p>I invited Dr. Charles Earl for this episode of my podcast "Job Interview" to talk about racial discrimination at the workplace and fairness in machine learning. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Charles Earl is a data scientist in Automattic, my previous place of work. Charles holds a Ph.D. in computer science, M.A. in education, M.Sc in Electrical engineering, and B.Sc in mathematics. His career covered a position of assistant professor and a wide range of hands-on, managerial, and consulting roles in the field that we like to call today "data science." </p>

<p>But there is another aspect in Dr. Earl. His skin is brown. He was born to an African-American family in Atlanta, GA, in the 1960s when racial segregation was explicitly legal. I am sure that this fact affected Charles' entire life, personal and professional.</p>
