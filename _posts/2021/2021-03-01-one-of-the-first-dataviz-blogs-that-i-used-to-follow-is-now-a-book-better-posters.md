I started following data visualization news and opinions quite a few years ago. One of the first bloggers who were active in this area [NeurDojo](http://neurodojo.blogspot.com), by the (now) professor Zen Faulkes. On of Zen's spin-off blogs was devoted to better posters. This poster blog is called, surprisingly enough, [Better Posters](http://betterposters.blogspot.com). Since I'm not in academia anymore, stopped caring about posters many years ago. Today, I stumbled upon this blog and was pleasantly surprised to discover that Better Posters is still active and that [it is also now a book](https://pelagicpublishing.com/products/better-posters-zen-faulkes).
