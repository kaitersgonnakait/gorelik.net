The great Robert Kosara, also known as the "[eager eyes](https://eagereyes.org)" has started publishing a series of videos he calls [Chart Appreciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqNuw9H7h8&list=PLbzq0eVw_4Dkqd5kuwY3uMANPvVBQ292V). In these videos, Robert takes a piece of data visualization from a reputable and known source, and discusses why this particular piece is so good, what decisions were made that made it possible, what alternatives are, and more. If you consider yourself an intermediate or advanced practitioner of data visualization, you should subscribe. Here's one example.
