Usually, I keep my blog for professional news only, but this time, I'll make an exception.

This frame is from a video that was taken a couple of days ago, less than one hour away from my home. Note how many people are there. 

Some people will claim that what we see is a peaceful protest by Palestinians against the Israeli occupation. Being a son and a grandson to the Holocaust survivors, I find it hard to connect to the peacefulness of what I see. I don't have to hear them chanting "from the River to the Sea Palestine will be free" to understand that what they, and many thousands more, really mean is "free of Jews".
