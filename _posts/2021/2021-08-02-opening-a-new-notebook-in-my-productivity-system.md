Those who know me, know that I always care with me a cheep and thin notebook which I use as an extension to my mind. Today, I opened a new notebook, and this is a good opportunity to share some links about my productivity system.

- Failed attempt with tangible boards is [here](https://gorelik.net/2019/11/11/a-tangible-productivity-tool-and-a-book-review/). This approach has an interesting idea behind it, but I couldn't stick with it. YMMW
- Failed attempt with digital/analog/tangible combo is [here](https://gorelik.net/2020/07/12/hybrid-digital-analog-tangible-week-planning/).
