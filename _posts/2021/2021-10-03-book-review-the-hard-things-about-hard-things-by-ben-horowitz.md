I read [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205) following recomendations by Reem Sherman, the host of the excellent (!!!) podcast [Geekonomy](https://geekonomy.net) (in Hebrew).

Ben Horowitz is a veteran manager and entrepreneur who found the company Opsware, which Hewlett-Packard acquired in  This book describes Horotwitz's journey in Opsware from the foundation to the sale. Book's second part is a collection of advice to working and aspiring CEOs. The last part is, actually, an advertisement for Horowitz's new project - a VC company.

## Things that I liked

The behind the scenes stories are interesting and inspiring.<br>Ben Horowitz devoted the second part of the book to share his experience as a CEO with other actual or aspiring CEOs. I don't work as a CEO, nor do I see myself in that position in the future. However, this part is valuable for people like me because it provides insights into how CEOs think. Moreover, "The Hard Things" is a popular book, and many managers learn from it.

## Things that I didn't like.

Ben Horowitz was a manager during the early days of the high-tech industry. As such, parts of his attitude are outdated. The most prominent example for this problem is a story that Horowitz tells, in which he asked the entire company to work 12+ hours a day, seven days a week for several months. He was very proud about this, but IMO, employees will not accept such a request in today's climate.

**The bottom line: 4/5**
