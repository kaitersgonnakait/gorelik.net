So, the data visualization workshop is fully booked. The organizers told me to expect 40-50 attendees and I need some assistance. I am looking for a person who will be able to answer technical questions such as "I got a syntax error", "why can't I see this graph?", "my graph has different colors".

It's a good opportunity to attend the workshop for free, to learn a lot of useful information, and to meet a lot of smart people.

It's a win-win situation. Contact me now at boris@gorelik.net
