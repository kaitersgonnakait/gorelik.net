Several people have asked me about the technology I used to create the graphs in my recent post about the [gender salary gap in the Israeli high-tech](http://Gender salary gap in the Israeli high-tech). Like 99% of the graphs I create, I used [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). I have uploaded the notebook that I used for that post to Github. [Here's the link](https://gist.github.com/bgbg/69ff79c50ddfc207399b39fddd513248). The published version uses [seaborn style settings](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html). The original one uses a slightly customized style.
