From time to time, I assume something, evaluate that assumption, and discover that the reality is opposite to what I thought it was. That's exactly what happened when I thought about the dynamics of Google searches for "create a site," compared to the searches for "create a blog." I was **sure** that there would be much more searches for "create a site." [I was wrong](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=create%20a%20blog,start%20a%20blog,create%20a%20site)

There are several interesting insights that one can drive from that small analysis.


     The number of people who search for "create a site" is continuously dropping.

     Ever since 2009, the number of searches for "create a site" is smaller than the number of searches for "create a blog." Why? I have no idea

     Blog creation search dynamics is also interesting. Both "start a blog" and "create a blog" have been decreasing since January  However, despite the fact that both the curves started at the same height, and reached the same peak, they did so in different trajectories. "Create a blog" reached a peak gradually, following a concave path. "Start a blog," on the other hand, reached the peak following a convex path that resembles exponential growth. For some reason, in January 2009 growth of both the searches stopped.

Usually, in posts like this, you would expect an analysis that explains the difference. I don't have any answers. However, if you have any hypothesis, I will be glad to hear.
