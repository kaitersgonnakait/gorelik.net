Overfitting is a situation in which a model accurately describes some data but not the phenomenon that generates that data. Overfitting was a huge problem in the good old times, where each data point was expensive, and researchers operated on datasets that could fit a single A4 sheet of paper. Today, with mega giga and tera-bytes datasets, overfitting is ... still a problem. A very painful one. Following is a short reading list on overfitting.

I would like to start with Mehmet Suzen mllib.wordpress.com who treats overfitting as "[inaccurate meme in supervised learning](https://mllib.wordpress.com/2017/08/17/understanding-overfitting-an-inaccurate-meme-in-supervised-learning/)"

> cross-validation does not prevent your model to overfit and good out-of-sample performance does not guarantee not-overfitted model.


Another blogger, whose name I couldn't find, has two very detailed posts on overfitting:

[Understanding overfitting from bias-variance trade-off](https://phychai.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/understanding-overfitting-from-bias-variance-trade-off/) and [Understanding overfitting from Haussler 1988 theorem](https://phychai.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/understanding-overfitting-from-haussler-1988-theorem/)

Finally, Adrian from the "morning paper" (please don't tell me you don't follow that blog) has [a summary of another paper](http://blog.acolyer.org/2017/05/11/understanding-deep-learning-requires-re-thinking-generalization/), titled "[Understanding deep learning requires re-thinking generalization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy8gdB9xx&noteId=Sy8gdB9xx)" (I only read Adrian's summary).

### Conclusion

No conclusions here. It's a reading list.
