Uncertainty is one of the most neglected aspects of number-based communication and one of the most important concepts in general numeracy. Comprehending uncertainty is hard. Visualizing it is, apparently, even harder.

Last week I read a paper called [Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/uncertainty-palettes), by M.Correll, D. Moritz, and J. Heer from the Data visualization and interactive analysis research at the University of Washington. This paper describes an interesting approach to color-encoding uncertainty.

Uncertainty visualization is commonly done by reducing color saturation and opacity.  Cornell et al suggest combining saturation reduction with limiting the number of possible colors in a color palette. Unfortunately, there the authors used [Javascript and not python for this paper](https://github.com/uwdata/vsup), which means that in the future, I *might* try implementing it in python.

Visualizing uncertainty is one of the most challenging tasks in data visualization. Uncertain
