You've been there: you need to complete a project, submit a report, or document your code. You know how important all these tasks are, but you can't find the power to do so. Instead, you're researching those nice pictures the [Opportunity rover sent to the Earth](https://www.google.co.il/search?q=opportunity+mars), type random letters in Google to see where they will lead you to, tidy up your desk, or make another cup of coffee. You are procrastinating.

Because I procrastinate a lot, and because I have several important tasks to complete, I decided to read more about the psychological background of procrastination. I went to Google Scholar and typed "procrastination." One of the first results was a paper with a promising title. "[The Nature of Procrastination: A Meta-Analytic and Theoretical Review of Quintessential Self-Regulatory Failure](http://studypedia.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf)" by Piers Steel. Why was I intrigued by this paper? First of all, it's a meta-analysis, meaning that it reviews many previous quantitative studies. Secondly, it promises a theoretical review, which is also a good thing. So, I decided to read it. I started from the abstract, and here's what I see:

Strong and consistent predictors of procrastination were task aversiveness, task delay, selfefficacy, and impulsiveness, as well as conscientiousness and its facets of self-control, distractibility, organization, and achievement motivation.

Hmmm, isn't this the very definition of procrastination? Isn't this sentence similar to "A strong predictor of obesity is a high ratio between person's weight to their height?". **Now**, I'm really intrigued. I am sure that reading this paper will shed some light, not only on the procrastination itself but also on the self-assuring sentence. I definitely need to read this paper. Maybe tomorrow.

 

PS. After writing this post, I discovered that the paper author, Piers Steel, has a blog dedicated to "procrastination and science" [https://procrastinus.com/](https://procrastinus.com/). I will read that blog too. But not today
