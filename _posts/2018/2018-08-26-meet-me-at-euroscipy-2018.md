I am excited to run a data visualization tutorial, and to give a data visualization talk during the 2018 EuroSciPy meeting in Trento, Italy.

My tutorial "Data visualization &mdash; from default and suboptimal to efficient and awesome"will take place on Sep 29 at 14:00. This is a two-hours tutorial during which I will cover between two to three examples. I will start with the default Matplotlib graph, and modify it step by step, to make a beautiful aid in technical communication. I will publish the tutorial notebooks immediately after the conference.

My talk "[Three most common mistakes in data visualization](https://www.euroscipy.org/2018/descriptions/Three%20most%20common%20mistakes%20in%20data%20visualization.html)" will be similar in nature to [the one I gave in Barcelona](http://gorelik.net/2018/03/21/three-most-common-mistakes-in-data-visualization-%e2%80%a8and-how-to-avoid-them-now-the-slides/) this March, but more condensed and enriched with information I learned since then.

If you plan attending EuroSciPy and want to chat with me about data science, data visualization, or remote working, write a message to [boris@gorelik.net](mailto:boris@gorelik.net).

Full conference program is available [here](https://www.euroscipy.org/2018/program.html).
