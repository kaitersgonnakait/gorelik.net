Histograms are, I think, the most popular way to visualize distributions. "Back in the old days," when most of my work was done in the console, and when creating a plot from Python was required too many boilerplate code lines, I found a neat function that produced histograms using ASCII characters.

Surely, today, when most of us work in a notebook environment, ASCII histograms aren't as useful as they used to be. However, they are still helpful. One scenario in which ASCII diagrams are useful is when you write a log file for an iterative process. A quick glimpse at the log file will let you know when the distribution of some scoring function reached convergence.

That is why I keep my version of `asciihist` updated since  You may find it on Github [here](https://gist.github.com/bgbg/608d9ef4fd75032731651257fe67fc81).
