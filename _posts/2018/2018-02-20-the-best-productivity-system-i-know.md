I am an awful procrastinator. I realized that, many years ago. Once I did, I started searching for productivity tips and systems. Of course, most of these searches are another form of procrastination. After all, it's much more fun to read about productivity than writing that boring report. In 2012, I discovered a TiddlyWiki that implements AutoFocus - a system developed by Mark Forster (AutoFocus instructions: [link](http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/), TiddlyWiki page [link](http://af4-demo.tiddlyspot.com/))

I loved the simplicity of that system and used it for a while. I also started following [Mark Forster's blog](http://markforster.squarespace.com). Pretty soon after that, Mark published another, even simpler version of that system, which he called "[The Final Version](http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109511856508.html)." I loved it even better and readily adopted it. For many reasons, I moved from TiddlyWiki to Trello and made several personal adjustments to the system.

At some point, I read "[59 seconds](https://books.google.co.il/books/about/59_Seconds.html?id=ZaNdiC2qIHwC&redir_esc=y&hl=en)"  in which the [psychologist Richard Wiseman](https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/) summarizes many psychological studies in the field of happiness, productivity, decision making, etc. From that book, I learned about the power of writing things down. It turns out, that when you write things down, your brain gets a better chance to analyze your thoughts and to make better decisions. I also learned from other sources about the importance to disconnect from the Internet several times a day. So, on November 2016, I made a transition from electronic productivity system to an old school notebook. In the beginning, I decided to keep that notebook as a month-long experiment, but I loved that very much. Since then, I have always had my analog productivity system and an introspection device with me. Today, I started my sixth notebook. I love my system so much, I actually consider writing a book about it.
