Yesterday, I talked in front of the Barcelona Data Science and Machine Learning Meetup about the most common mistakes in data visualization. I enjoyed talking with the local community very much. Judging by the feedback I received during and after the talk, they too, enjoyed my presentation. I uploaded my slides to Slideshare.
