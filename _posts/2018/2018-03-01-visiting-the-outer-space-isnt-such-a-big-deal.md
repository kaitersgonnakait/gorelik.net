I know a lot of people who dreamt of being a cosmonaut or an astronaut. I was one of them. Did you know that visiting the outer space isn't such a big deal? Since the Yuri Gagarin'sÂ first flight to space in 1961, 557 more people flew to space. Unfortunately, not all of them survived the trip [[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_astronauts_by_first_flight)].

### On the other hand

There are 193 UN member countries. Do you know that, according to Wikipedia, there are only 13 (thirteen!) people who are confirmed to visit all of these countries? [[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_by_number_of_countries_visited)] It's 43 times less than the number of astronauts!
