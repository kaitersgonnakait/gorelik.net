If you ever gave or attended a presentation, you are familiar with this situation: the presenter asks whether there are any questions and ... nobody asks anything. This is an awkward situation. Why aren't there any questions? Is it because everything is clear? Not likely. Everything is never clear. Is it because nobody cares? Well, maybe. There are certainly many people that don't care. It's a fact of life. Study your audience, work hard to make the presentation relevant and exciting but still, some people won't care. Deal with it.

However, the bigger reasons for lack of the questions are human laziness and the fear of being stupid. Nobody likes asking a question that someone will perceive as a stupid one. Sometimes, some people don't mind asking a question but are embarrassed and prefer not being the first one to break the silence.

What can you do? Usually, I prepare one or two questions by myself. In this case, if nobody asks anything, I say something like "Some people, when they see these results ask me whether it is possible to scale this method to larger sets.". Then, depending on how confident you are, you may provide the answer or ask "What do you think?".

You can even prepare a slide that answers your question. In the screenshot below, you may see the slide deck of the presentation I gave in Trento. The blue slide at the end of the deck is the final slide, where I thank the audience for the attention and ask whether there are any questions.

My plan was that if nobody asks me anything, I would say "Thank you again. If you want to learn more practical advises about data visualization, watch the recording of my tutorial, where I present this methodÂ  <SLIDE TRANSFER, show the mockup of the "book">. Also, many people ask me about reading suggestions, this is what I suggest you read: <SLIDE TRANSFER, show the reading pointers>

Luckily for me, there were questions after my talk. Luckily, one of these questions was about practical advice so I had a perfect excuse to show the next, pre-prepared, slide. Watch this moment on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/3btpy146nGc?t=1h39m45s).
