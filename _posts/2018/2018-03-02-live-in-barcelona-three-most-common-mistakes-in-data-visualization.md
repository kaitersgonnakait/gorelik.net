On Thursday, March 20, I will give a talk titled "Three most common mistakes in data visualization and how to avoid them." I will be a guest of the [Barcelona Data Science and Machine Learning Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/barcelona-data-science-machine-learning/). Right now, less than twenty-four hours after the lecture announcement, there are already seventeen people on the waiting list. I feel a lot of responsibility and am very excited.
