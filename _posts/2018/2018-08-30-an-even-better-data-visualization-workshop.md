Yesterday, I gave a data visualization workshop at EuroSciPy 2018 in Trento. I spent HOURs building and improving it. I even developed a "simple to use, easy to follow, never failing formula" for data visualization process (I'll write about it later).

I enjoyed this workshop **so much**. Both preparing it, and (even more so) delivering it. There were so many useful questions and remarks. The most important remark was made by [Gael Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info/) who pointed out that one of my examples was suboptimal for vision impaired people. The embarrassing part is that one of the last lectures that I gave in my college data visualization course was about visual communication for the visually impaired. That is why the first thing I did when I came to my hotel after the workshop was to fix the error. You may find all the (corrected) material I used in this workshop [on GitHub](https://github.com/bgbg/datascience_dataviz_workshop/releases/tag/20180828-euroscipy2018-fix). Below, is the video of the workshop, in case you want to follow it.
