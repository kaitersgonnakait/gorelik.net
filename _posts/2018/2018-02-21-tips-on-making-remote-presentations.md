Today, I made a presentation to the faculty of the [Chisinau ](http://www.math.md/en/)
[Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://www.math.md/en/). The audience gathered in a conference room in Chisinau, and I was in my home office in Israel.

Following is a list of useful tips for this kind of presentations.


     When presenting, it is very important to see your audience. Thus, use two monitors. Use one monitor for screen sharing, and the other one to see the audience

     Put the (Skype) window that shows your audience under the camera. This way you'll look most natural on the other side of the teleconference.

     Starting a presentation in Powerpoint or Keynote "kidnaps" all the displays. You will not be able to see the audience when that happens. I export the presentation to a PDF file and use Acrobat Reader in full-screen mode. The up and down buttons in my presentation remote control work with the Reader. The "make screen black" button doesn't.

     I open a "lightable view" of my presentation and put it next to the audience screen. It's not as useful as seeing the presenter's notes using a "real" presentation program, but it is good enough.

     Stand up! Usually, we stand up when we present in front of live audience. For some reason, when presenting remotely, people tend to sit. A sitting person is less dynamic and looks less engaging. I have a standing desk which allows me to stand up and to raise the camera to my face level. If you can't raise the camera, stay sitting. You don't want your audience staring at your groin.
