A couple of days ago, I told to my oldest daughter about the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem), the famous probability puzzle with a counter-intuitive solution. My daughter didn't believe me. Even when I told her all about the probabilities, the added information, and the other stuff, she still couldn't "feel" it. I looked for an online simulator and couldn't find anything that I liked. So, I decided to create a simulation Jupyter notebook.

I've uploaded the notebook to GitHub, in case someone else wants to play with it [[link](https://gist.github.com/bgbg/62f5d67f054abbdaa865bfd64200c1d1)].
