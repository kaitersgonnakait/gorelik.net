## TL/DR

 

**What**: Data Visualization from default to outstanding. Test cases of tough data visualization

**Why: **  You would never settle for default settings of a machine learning algorithm. Instead, you would tweak them to obtain optimal results. Similarly, you should never stop with the default results you receive from a data visualization framework. Sadly, most of you do.

**When:** May 27, 2018 (a day before the DataScience summit)/ 13:00  16:00

**Where**:  Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) at Herzliya.

**Timeline**:
 Theoretical introduction: three most common mistakes in data visualization (45 minutes)
 Test case (LAB): Plotting several radically different time series on a single graph (45 minutes)
 Test case (LAB): Bar chart as an effective alternative to a pie chart (45 minutes)
 Test case (LAB): Pie chart as an effective alternative to a bar chart (45 minutes)

## More words

According to the conference organizers, the yearly Data Science Summit is the biggest data science event in Israel. This year, the conference will take place in Tel Aviv on Monday, May  One day before the main conference, there will be a workshop day, hosted at the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center. I'm super excited to host one of the workshops, during the afternoon session. During this workshop, we will talk about the mistakes data scientist make while visualizing their data and the way to avoid them. We will also have some fun creating various charts, comparing the results, and trying to learn from each others' mistakes.
