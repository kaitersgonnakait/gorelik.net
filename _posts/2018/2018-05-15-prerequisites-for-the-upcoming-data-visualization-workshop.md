I have been told that the data visualization workshop ("[Data Visualization from default to outstanding. Test cases of tough data visualization](http://gorelik.net/2018/05/01/i-will-host-a-data-visualization-workshop-at-israels-biggest-data-science-event/)") is completely sold out. If you plan to attend this workshop, please check out the repository that I created for it [[link](https://github.com/bgbg/datascience_dataviz_workshop)]. In that repository, you will find a list of pre-requisites that you absolutely need to meet before the workshop. Also, it will be very helpful if you could fill [this poll](http://bit.ly/ds2018dataviz) which will help me prepare for the workshop.

See you soon
