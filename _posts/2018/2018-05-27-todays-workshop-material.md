Today, I hosted a data visualization workshop, as a part of the workshop day adjacent to the fourth Israeli Data Science Summit. I really enjoyed this workshop, especially the follow-up questions. These questions are  the reason I volunteer talking about data visualization every time I can. It may sound strange, but I learn a lot from the questions people ask me.

If you want to see the code, you may [find it on GitHub](https://github.com/bgbg/datascience_dataviz_workshop). The slide deck is [available on Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/borisgorelik/three-most-common-mistakes-in-data-visualization)
