My stand on learning data science is known: I think that learning "data science" as a career move is a mistake. You may read [this long rant of mine](http://gorelik.net/2017/05/29/dont-study-data-science/) to learn why I think so. This doesn't mean that I think that studying data science, in general, is a waste of time.

Let me explain this confusion. Take this blogger for example [https://thegirlyscientist.com/](https://thegirlyscientist.com/). As of this writing, "thegirlyscientst" has only two posts: "[Is my finance degree useless?](https://thegirlyscientist.com/2018/02/12/finance-degree/)" and "[How in the world do I learn data science?](https://thegirlyscientist.com/2018/02/19/data-science-project/)". This person (whom I don't know) seems to be a perfect example of someone may learn data science tools to solve problems in their professional domain. This is exactly how my professional career evolved, and I consider myself very lucky about that. I'm a strong believer that successful data scientists outside the academia should evolve either from domain knowledge to data skills or from statistical/CS knowledge to domain-specific skills. Learning "data science" as a collection of short courses, without deep knowledge in some domain, is in my opinion, a waste of time. I'm constantly doubting myself with this respect but I haven't seen enough evidence to change my mind. If you think I miss some point, please correct me.
