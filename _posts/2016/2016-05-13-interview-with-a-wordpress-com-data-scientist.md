Two weeks ago, I gave an interview to Matthew Kaboomis Loomis from http://www.buildyourownblog.net. This was my first time, and I was pretty nervous. During the interview, Matthew and I talked about the recent findings that I have published in my [previous post](https://randomstratum.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/a-problem-shared-is-a-problem-halved-2/). Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the interview.
