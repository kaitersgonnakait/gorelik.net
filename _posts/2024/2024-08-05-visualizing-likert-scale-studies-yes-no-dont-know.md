<br>A Likert scale study is a type of survey that measures respondents' attitudes or opinions across a range of agreement levels.<br><br>Unfortunately, many visualizations for Likert scale data are poorly designed and fail to effectively convey the results.<br><br>To address this, I wrote a Python function that generates decent visualizations for Likert scale data. It also handles text in both Hebrew and Arabic, which is not a trivial task in Matplotlib.
