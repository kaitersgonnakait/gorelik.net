For the past three and a half years, I've hosted the Hebrew podcast [This Week in the Middle East Podcast](https://www.linkedin.com/company/this-week-in-the-middle-east-podcast/) . Despite not being a Middle Eastern studies expert and knowing little Arabic, my passion and curiosity have led me on a remarkable journey of sharing knowledge and public speaking.

Each week, I've engaged with experts on various topics, providing insights into the Middle East and highlighting the importance of diverse voices. This experience has reinforced the value of knowledge sharing and open dialogue.

Recently, a major channel invited me to discuss Ramadan, despite my lacking of of formal credentials.

This illustrates that expertise extends beyond degrees to include passion, learning, and effective communication. 

I am already perceived as a [#datavisualization](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=datavisualization&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7174010530079100928) expert, and now, people start asking for my opinion in a completely different field. How did this happen? 

It starts with you talking about something, then fearing to sound foolish, you learn about the subject to avoid embarrassment, and indeed, you become an expert

As we progress in our careers and lives, the significance of voicing our thoughts, exchanging ideas, and embracing various viewpoints becomes clear. Through such engagements, we evolve, learn, and foster meaningful discussions. Let's keep breaking barriers through conversation.
