This post shares my recent experiences witnessing the resilience and innovation of Israelis. From mobilizing workers and students to volunteer efforts and professional development, we continually advance under challenging conditions.

In October 2023, Israel was in the midst of a political crisis. Then, we were attacked with unprecedented brutality, halting the entire economy. With nothing to do, I joined a volunteer team. We utilized our data expertise to build an OSINT analysis tools for the war effort. Initially, none of us knew each other or who know what. Yet, two weeks later, dozens of volunteer analysts were using our tools in three shifts, providing crucial support.

As a freelance data researcher, I was surprised to see how my clients, despite the difficulties, continued to work. They managed to meet deadlines even when some had to deal with employees who were killed, wounded, or enlisted into the reserves, and others who were present but absent due to friends or family being killed, injured, or enlisted.

I saw freelancers like myself joining startups at subsidized rates in place of missing employees to help meet deadlines and advance projects. This partnership not only demonstrated innovation but also showed the great solidarity that is so characteristic of Israeli society.

Additionally, a few weeks ago, I volunteered for reserve duty from which I’m exempt due to my age. I saw reservists of different ages, men and women, engaged in routine security tasks for the Israeli Defense Forces, with many continuing to work in their spare time—some on their work tasks, some on their studies, and others sitting in a corner discussing new business ideas.

I also lecture at a college. The entire college—the lecturers, the dean, the secretariat—everyone is mobilized to help students affected by the war progress towards their degrees as much as possible. This academic year is anything but usual, and yet, the second semester is over, and it looks like most of the students managed to overcome the challenges.

Everything I have seen reinforces the belief that Israel faces a bright future. Our innovation continues to improve. The recent influx of Jews, driven by waves of anti-Semitism in the West, adds even more strength and innovation. Before the war, Israel ranked among the top countries in wealth and innovation. I am confident that even after the war, we will maintain our high position and continue to strengthen our innovation and wealth.
