Two weeks ago, I published a research paper [Ethnic Divisions Within Unity: Insights into Intra-Group Segregation from Israel’s Ultra-Orthodox Society](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/14/3/169). It is my first paper in so many aspects

I have a confession to make. When I concluded the research phase, I stumbled upon an open question that I couldn't answer. I really wanted to publish what I already had, so instead of trying to deemphasize the problem or write far-fetched theories, I decided to put the problem under a spotlight and declare it loud and clear, emphasizing that this publication is a chance to deal with **publication bias** — a phenomenon that leads scientific journals to favor positive or significant findings while neglecting studies that yield negative or inconclusive results.

## This is not the end

Once the paper got published, I recalled that a sizable audience of my podcast ([This Week in the Middle East](https://anchor.fm/hashavua)) belongs to the Haredi society - the society that was the subject of my study. I recorded a video presentation (here: [it's in Hebrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ix-wutbKMk&ab_channel=%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9FThisWeekintheMiddleEast)), asking my podcast audience to share their inner knowledge and propose explanations. What do you know? I got several very interesting ones - that will serve as the basis for further research.
