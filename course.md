Many people know how important data visualization is. However, mastering a visualization tool is not enough to convey a message or and to change others’ minds and actions. For that, you need to rely on concepts from the physiology of vision, color perception, and many aspects of human psychology.

Once you start studying these concepts, you will understand why two graphs can lead to opposite conclusions despite being based on the same data; or why it was possible to reduce the error rate in diagnosing a heart condition by almost 50% by changing a color scheme.

Join this course to learn the science behind many real-life examples. I have designed this course to be tool-neutral. It doesn't matter if your tool of choice is Python, R, or Excel — you will find the information interesting and applicable.

To provide more applied aspects, some lectures are accompanied by "before and after" demo sessions in which I demonstrate practical aspects of the rules learned in the lectures. These sessions use Python but will be relevant to any practitioner as they concentrate on what you do, not what you use.
