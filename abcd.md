This is the deal: if 180 people will be willing to pay $5 each, before November 2020, I will write this book. Every early adopter will get a free electronic copy of this book once is done.

Why? The only reason to write a book is so people will read it. Paying actual money is a good signal of true interest. I will use this money for professional proofreading and editing. 

Interested in reading this book? Pay now!

I promise

- I will update all the supporters about the progress
- If there is no enough interest in the book, I will donate all the money to a charity organization.
